`unix_mode` provides functions to decode, interpret, and display Unix mode bits
and permissions, even on non-Unix platforms.

On Unix, decoding is supported by `std::os::unix::fs` in the standard library,
but this crate adds a function to render them in the format used by `ls -l`, and
to understand the file type and permissions.

    assert_eq!(unix_mode::to_string(0o0040755), "drwxr-xr-x");
    assert_eq!(unix_mode::to_string(0o0100640), "-rw-r-----");

    assert_eq!(unix_mode::is_symlink(0o0040755), false);
